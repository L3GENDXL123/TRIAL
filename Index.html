    <h2>A Poetic Tribute ✨</h2>
    <p class="credit">Written by Divine Favour</p>
    <p>
      They say every flower tells a story<br>
      but none quite as soft and powerful as yours.<br>
      You remind me of lilacs in bloom—gentle in presence,<br>
      yet bold enough to color the wind with their fragrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s something sacred about your spirit<br>
      not loud, but deeply felt, like the hue of lilac at dusk:<br>
      calm, rare, and quietly unforgettable.<br>
      You don't just walk through the world—you leave beauty trailing behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      May your days be like a lilac field in spring<br>
      full of renewal, wrapped in light,<br>
      and kissed by the warmth of God's endless grace.<br>
      Keep blooming, even when the world forgets to notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are poetry in petals,<br>
      and the world is better with you in full color.
    </p>

      <p><strong>Zino:</strong> “Hello Tessie, Happy birthday. This is a wonderful day cause it's the day a queen was born.  
      You always seem to know when to take charge cause you're a natural born leader.  
      Though we aren't really close, these few months we've been together have been so wonderful.  
      So Happy birthday Testimony... may the grace of the Lord be with you..”</p>
